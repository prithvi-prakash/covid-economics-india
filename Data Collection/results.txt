1576766793414168576 2022-10-02 21:51:13 -0500 <pprakash94> As much as Klopp, FT, and the fanbase continue to vehemently deny, we miss Mane every single day. Not just his goals, his defensive-work rate, chemistry, directness, drive, and I'd suspect his presence in the locker room as well.
1576706888137179136 2022-10-02 17:53:10 -0500 <pprakash94> 🤣🤣
1576282500460003333 2022-10-01 13:46:48 -0500 <pprakash94> The rate at which AI is progressing - insane.
1569428869962145793 2022-09-12 15:52:55 -0500 <pprakash94> The memories on this hits different. 😭
1567601721290932227 2022-09-07 14:52:29 -0500 <pprakash94> The entire backline and midfield have been horrific. Frontline anonymous. We need a massive, massive rebuild.
1564601088732438531 2022-08-30 08:09:03 -0500 <pprakash94> Sums up most of my school/undergrad years. 🤣
1555226287848837120 2022-08-04 11:16:56 -0500 <pprakash94> Did that all the time. 😂
1555224937509502976 2022-08-04 11:11:34 -0500 <pprakash94> Django x React (moving to something more scalable than Flask) PyTorch (moving away from TensorFlow).
1548771660278337537 2022-07-17 15:48:33 -0500 <pprakash94> Absolutely beautiful.
1548407102468546561 2022-07-16 15:39:55 -0500 <pprakash94> When you see someone you love in love with someone else (and they look really good together) 😭😭
1542089904640753664 2022-06-29 05:17:38 -0500 <pprakash94> It’s past 3:15 AM and I FINALLY fixed the issue that was keeping my Neural Network from training properly. Can 100% vouch for this feeling.   Now I can’t go to sleep thinking about how the final model will turn out. 😆
1541655270966820864 2022-06-28 00:30:33 -0500 <pprakash94> That 15/16 season as strange as it was will always have a special place in my heart for memories like this.
1539822937682759680 2022-06-22 23:09:31 -0500 <pprakash94> Gonna be an incredible season ahead for Mane.
1534669516881506304 2022-06-08 17:51:40 -0500 <pprakash94> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1531325887257448448 2022-05-30 12:25:16 -0500 <pprakash94> @simamuofficial Not a bad take tbh. On paper Ox's skillset is most ideal to play as the right sided No. 8. The reality however, is that he's been awful and out of form for sometime now and the squad selection reflects that. Had Origi not been injured he would not have made the bench.
1530608569598500864 2022-05-28 12:54:54 -0500 <pprakash94> Team sheet out, feels so surreal. Let's do this. Bring back number 7.
1530187948301422592 2022-05-27 09:03:31 -0500 <pprakash94> Honestly, not the worst take. I don't believe Son is better than Salah or Mane, but put him in a team that's filled with world class players, and he would not be far off.
1521976499611574272 2022-05-04 17:14:09 -0500 <pprakash94> The coldest tweet I've seen.
1515368461735768064 2022-04-16 11:36:10 -0500 <pprakash94> @AbsNaiAaRheYaar Told you bruh.
1515193837546782724 2022-04-16 00:02:16 -0500 <pprakash94> @JotaFanV1 No. I kinda agree he hasn’t had a great season by his usual standards. But what made you put Ox and Gomez above him? Is there something I’m missing?
1515179321400430594 2022-04-15 23:04:35 -0500 <pprakash94> @JotaFanV1 It’s not about what I wish. Just want to understand your rationale behind keeping Gomez and Ox a tier above Henderson.
1515147357339463691 2022-04-15 20:57:34 -0500 <pprakash94> @JotaFanV1 How are Ox and Gomez in the Ok category while Henderson is in the Bad category?
1511883587871813632 2022-04-06 20:48:31 -0500 <pprakash94> Lmao.
1511090596290740235 2022-04-04 16:17:27 -0500 <pprakash94> @ramakrishnannn Never have I ever… seen “food” like this before. 😖
1510649903990644738 2022-04-03 11:06:18 -0500 <pprakash94> @TheAnfieldTalk This is one of those games where we have to play the trusted front 3. We know what we're gonna get.  Depending on the scoreline and how the game is playing out inject in some pace/poacher by bringing on Diaz and/or Jota.
1501065576378155017 2022-03-07 23:21:36 -0500 <pprakash94> This would be the first time the Transfer Window Champions go down the same season. 😳
1497611995121471488 2022-02-26 10:38:18 -0500 <pprakash94> @AbsNaiAaRheYaar Bit harsh bro. Don't think he's done, just a player that's declined and playing in a bang average team.
1491231138308042753 2022-02-08 20:03:03 -0500 <pprakash94> Sadio Mane. Absolute legend.
1483671882683621378 2022-01-18 23:25:16 -0500 <pprakash94> @hpsam Omg you got it? How are you?
1473827202475053057 2021-12-22 19:26:02 -0500 <pprakash94> @lee_jones11 You seems to be forgetting this. https://t.co/is64mV401t
1469771569069273105 2021-12-11 14:50:23 -0500 <pprakash94> @AbsNaiAaRheYaar @GNev2 My thoughts too. Absolutely shameless.
1469736263582429187 2021-12-11 12:30:06 -0500 <pprakash94> What is this guy on about. 🙈 Ralf Rangnick is one of the best tactical coaches out there.
1462147960909668354 2021-11-20 13:56:53 -0500 <pprakash94> @noobharish Did Mane even commit a foul? These Arsenal players are just too soft.
1461031438002925568 2021-11-17 12:00:14 -0500 <pprakash94> @meghakowdley This was beautiful.
1458831072549085197 2021-11-11 10:16:46 -0500 <pprakash94> @the_irishguy Great trivia here. I remember the Gareth Barry to Liverpool transfer saga back in 08/09. What I still can’t believe is Rafa wanted to get rid of Xabi Alonso to accommodate him.
1456102882760134656 2021-11-03 22:35:54 -0500 <pprakash94> Not a Ronaldo fan, but Ludovico Peter Drury's commentary to the background of Einaudi's Experience - simply beautiful. 😍
1454480721670819846 2021-10-30 11:10:01 -0500 <pprakash94> Reminds of the good old days, Klopp’s first full season - 2016/17, brilliant one week, bang average the next. Looks like we’re having a bit of relapse. 😖
1453437112657846275 2021-10-27 14:03:05 -0500 <pprakash94> Worst I've seen.   No Fabinho, aka the best DM itw right now? Alphonso Davies is nowhere near as consistent as Robertson. And how is Muller ahead of Mane?
1449405673964408844 2021-10-16 11:03:35 -0500 <pprakash94> Ole at the wheel. 😂 #LEIMUN
1436890265701257220 2021-09-11 22:11:50 -0500 <pprakash94> @BobbyF77LFC @puxswap @AbemSeifu Perfectly said. Respect your opponents and their efforts. But supporting players? What an absolute joke.
1432016083226173441 2021-08-29 11:23:34 -0500 <pprakash94> @Pragmatic_CFC @soodkinzzz @TheIampardView And a single frame from a 90 minute match is supposed to be a more fair assessment of the game?
1431881128353439749 2021-08-29 02:27:18 -0500 <pprakash94> @soodkinzzz @TheIampardView What a shame that this led to goal. 😂 Time for some real stats.   https://t.co/r0DnyzkQkf
1430649619357306883 2021-08-25 16:53:44 -0500 <pprakash94> So true. Both punched well above their weights the whole of last season.
1410244102898130945 2021-06-30 09:29:29 -0500 <pprakash94> Rafa in the blue of Everton? Gonna be sick. 😞😣🥴😖🤢🤮
1409416213285904391 2021-06-28 02:39:45 -0500 <pprakash94> Very irresponsible of Prashant Bhushan to fan the already dangerous anti-vaxxer flame.  Our media really needs to take it upon themselves to promote a stronger scientific temperament among the masses.
1405897821375528964 2021-06-18 09:38:55 -0500 <pprakash94> Firmino's movement as a false 9 - dropping deep and dragging the opposing CB out of position; Mane holding the width and making that run from out to occupy the vacated space. Positional play it's absolute best.
1403773653599199232 2021-06-12 12:58:14 -0500 <pprakash94> The CPR Eriksen received probably saved his life. Everyone should learn it if the unfortunate were to ever happen.
1403769316391092225 2021-06-12 12:41:00 -0500 <pprakash94> The football world can breathe a sigh of relief.  Massive, massive respect to the medical staff, match officials, and the players for handling the situation so professionally.  Eriksen is now conscious. Hope he makes a quick recovery.
1403760081519316993 2021-06-12 12:04:18 -0500 <pprakash94> My goodness. Praying for Eriksen to pull through. Absolutely heartbreaking sight. 🙏
1403697687023669249 2021-06-12 07:56:22 -0500 <pprakash94> What a legend. 🙏🏽 The recipe looks absolutely lit. 🔥
1402964653886480385 2021-06-10 07:23:33 -0500 <pprakash94> I'm old enough to remember this awful take being an absolute banger back in the day. 😂
1396558255883571201 2021-05-23 15:06:49 -0500 <pprakash94> The way the parents' faces lit up though. 😭😭😭
1395396179580522507 2021-05-20 10:09:09 -0500 <pprakash94> @gowrisrikanth95 I swear! 😭
1394637721205821445 2021-05-18 07:55:18 -0500 <pprakash94> I still can't believe this ACTUALLY happened. This amazing moment only made better with the rain and the tears that followed.  We will never witness something like this ever again.
1394310592240832514 2021-05-17 10:15:24 -0500 <pprakash94> This is Renaissance art. ♥️
1392767054495707137 2021-05-13 04:01:56 -0500 <pprakash94> Of all the state sanctioned mistakes made thus far, this is arguably the most tone-deaf, and worst of the lot. We face an acute shortage of oxygen, and vaccines while the GOI continues this project. Given the risk do the lives of these workers not matter? Delhi HC must step in.
1387426934166982657 2021-04-28 10:22:12 -0500 <pprakash94> No words could come close to describing the pain this man must've felt here. Imagine doing everything you can to save your loved one only for your last hope to be snatched way like this. Absolutely heartbroken. 💔
1387308078761054208 2021-04-28 02:29:55 -0500 <pprakash94> @lostbagur You forgot - if you break any of the neighbours’ window everyone should pick up the nearest item and run.  Match abandoned due to unfavourable playing conditions. 😂
1382421651451572226 2021-04-14 14:53:00 -0500 <pprakash94> @lostbagur My father seems to think so. 😂
1366650181098246148 2021-03-02 01:22:48 -0500 <pprakash94> @t__lfc I remember him being pretty good at Everton away and even Tottenham away. But at some point he turned awful.  Crazy to think about because last season alongside Virgil he was probably the best player in the world.
1366491990943096833 2021-03-01 14:54:13 -0500 <pprakash94> @t__lfc Tbf he was pretty good at the start of the season. But true, he’s absolutely awful now. Looks a shadow of the player he was last season. The intensity is completely gone.
1362801775963557890 2021-02-19 10:30:37 -0500 <pprakash94> @ReshuNath I’m left-handed and I can confirm this is true. Even if the front-right burner is occupied I move things around to cook only on it.
1359126783572905984 2021-02-09 07:07:31 -0500 <pprakash94> Just finished listening to @amitvarma’s excellent conversation with @ajay_shah on the newly passed Farm Bills on The Seen and The Unseen. Highly recommend it to anybody who’s interested getting a nuanced take that goes beyond the blind, tribal partisanship. #FarmBills2020 https://t.co/40fkuvjWoA

1356834049491275776 2021-02-02 23:17:00 -0500 <pprakash94> The standard of refereeing in the league is beyond abysmal.  What even is the point of VAR if it’s in the hands of people who can’t make consistent decisions?
1355978145967472642 2021-01-31 14:35:57 -0500 <pprakash94> In tears. A CB at last. 😭😭😭😭
1353769461409476608 2021-01-25 12:19:26 -0500 <pprakash94> Spot on. Textbook example of how our left wing continues to lose credibility and mainstream support.
1353767070048022528 2021-01-25 12:09:55 -0500 <pprakash94> @PandeyAshish482 Exactly bro. Absolute ruthlessness. Can’t believe even Lampard wasn’t spared. 😞
1353689005615771679 2021-01-25 06:59:43 -0500 <pprakash94> Speechless.  Frank needed more time. Always painful to see a legend of the game depart in such an unceremonious way.
1351157639875538944 2021-01-18 07:20:59 -0500 <pprakash94> @Agrimonious @come4come How much? Interested. 🙋‍♂️
1350842051407986688 2021-01-17 10:26:57 -0500 <pprakash94> This team will get absolutely outplayed in the air. The complete lack of arial presence is where we lose this game, especially when they throw Cavani on.  Midfield really needs to step up and control the game. We win if Gini performs.  #LIVMUN
1350326958563983360 2021-01-16 00:20:09 -0500 <pprakash94> @AnfieldEdition Beats hearing, “Lallana coming back from injury is like a new signing.” 😆
1348678214219046912 2021-01-11 11:08:38 -0500 <pprakash94> @caelan_mulligan @utd_jr @JotinhoLFC @_Riddxck Rio Ferdinand is perhaps one of the only few defenders alongside perhaps Maldini to check every box.  The one thing I would like to point out that’s unique about Virgil, however, is how quickly he single handedly changed Liverpool’s defense taking them from worst to best.
1348600895957700619 2021-01-11 06:01:24 -0500 <pprakash94> Star Roster ✅ Great storyline ✅ Amazing finishing moves ✅ JR’s voice cracking on commentary. ✅ WWE/F done right.
1346530196334080000 2021-01-05 12:53:10 -0500 <pprakash94> @ReshuNath Further evidence that the “Left” and the “Liberals” must be treated as mutually distinct.  With how overly intolerant both ends of the political spectrum is getting, it genuinely looks like the centrists are the only true liberals left.
1345776061284372480 2021-01-03 10:56:30 -0500 <pprakash94> @AnfieldEdition Remember the match like it was yesterday. 08/09 season. Utd took the lead with Tevez from a Berbatov cut back.  LFC equalised with an OG from Wes Brown.  Giggs tried to shield the ball going for a goal kick but it got nicked off him and Kuyt cut the ball back for Babel to score.
1344272154150408194 2020-12-30 07:20:31 -0500 <pprakash94> @hpsam For the record - 3 times a week.

1323576098525904897 2020-11-03 04:41:47 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ You’re making zero sense buddy.  As stated earlier, let’s just agree to disagree. 👍🏼
1323567345927774209 2020-11-03 04:07:00 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ I’ve already made my stance clear about insult vs free speech. You’ve on the other hand been professing on and on about “objective morality”.  Why don’t you define it?
1323543358573219840 2020-11-03 02:31:41 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ Every time your logic is applied to anything outside of your views they’re a “Strawman” apparently. You have your views, the world has have their own. Let’s agree to disagree. 👍🏼
1323534861081010178 2020-11-03 01:57:55 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ Many Scientologists would disagree and term you calling them a “cult” as hate speech.  Call it whatever you want chief, your logical falls apart the moment you apply it to views that fall outside of your own.
1323534343050989568 2020-11-03 01:55:52 -0500 <pprakash94> @NilimDutta @Burairss @Ssaniya_ Glad you see no common sense in it.  I’m merely reapplying his “blasphemy logic” to a view we would be able reach a consensus on.
1323519847251148800 2020-11-03 00:58:16 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ I never said morality. I said that for, “free speech”.   You consider it a cult but some regard it as a religion. By your own absurd logic, you have committed offense, insult, and blasphemy according to the Church of Scientology and hence should face legal consequences.
1323513703094915072 2020-11-03 00:33:51 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ Again, all entirely down the perspective of the individual of what’s “acceptable”.  I’m sure your take on Scientology will offend sentiments and hence your logic defeats itself.
1323474391221501955 2020-11-02 21:57:38 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ Short answer, yes. It encompasses it.
1323297320926994432 2020-11-02 10:14:01 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ Would you deny that human beings were brought to Earth in a spacecraft 75 million years ago by the dictator of the Galactic Confederacy, Xenu? If yes, you’ve just offended the sentiments of the Church of Scientology.
1323293947175739394 2020-11-02 10:00:37 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ Again a deliberate misrepresentation of my point.   I suppose you could argue for some level of “objective morality” even thought it’d be highly debatable, but religious blasphemy certainly wouldn’t fall under it.   What you define as insult again is entirely subjective.
1323281624558047233 2020-11-02 09:11:39 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ I was “defining the boundaries”. But I agree that there is some moral grounding. However, it’s important to understand that the morality remains entirely subjective to the occupants of the land, and most secular states do not put restrictions of FoE for religions.
1323278995190734848 2020-11-02 09:01:12 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ You’re unfortunately doing your best to miss my point. The scope of FoE is everything that can possibly be said. How far from the mean a person chooses to venture away from it is down to the individual.
1323276388460240896 2020-11-02 08:50:50 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ One person’s free speech is another is insulting to another person and vice versa. Which is why legally there’s should be no constraints and the restrictions should be driven by the sensitivity of the individuals. If that unfortunately insults one’s  beliefs then ignore it.
1323274756313903104 2020-11-02 08:44:21 -0500 <pprakash94> @NilimDutta @Burairss @Ssaniya_ Glad we’re on the same page to question/criticise these defaulters. 😆👍🏼
1323271440888602625 2020-11-02 08:31:11 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ Not my point buddy. To reiterate my point - I support being respectful 100%.  Freedom of speech definitely has social constraints, but legally speaking there are none in secular states for religious reasons, unless specified so explicitly by law.
1323251269947985922 2020-11-02 07:11:02 -0500 <pprakash94> @NilimDutta @Burairss @Ssaniya_ Okay... what’s your point? Assuming you have one, ie.
1323247087635456001 2020-11-02 06:54:25 -0500 <pprakash94> @NilimDutta @Burairss @Ssaniya_ Exactly why the law of the land (not just France) should overrule any restrictions imposed by any religion.
1323242694433370112 2020-11-02 06:36:57 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ Agreed. I don’t condone the denigration of folks belonging to any religion.  That being said, it’s unfair to expect everyone to comply with your standards of censorship and restrictions in the name of religious sentiments. There’s a reason secular law exists.
1323221353659396096 2020-11-02 05:12:09 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @NilimDutta @Ssaniya_ As @NilimDutta said, live and let live.  Your beliefs are your personal choice, but cannot be treated as the absolute, infallible truth.  The same goes for every other religious person.
1323201465553354754 2020-11-02 03:53:07 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @Ssaniya_ @NilimDutta Idea, religion, revelation - I’ll leave the choice of lexicon up to you. The principle stands and must remain consistent across the board.
1323178441538088961 2020-11-02 02:21:38 -0500 <pprakash94> @NilimDutta https://t.co/uQVSdoHG28
1323172450155159557 2020-11-02 01:57:50 -0500 <pprakash94> @NilimDutta I’d be more than happy to join you in honestly criticising/questioning the ones you call oppressors, but that was never where our opinions diverged.  I’m just merely reiterating that no idea should be beyond criticism.
1323163028536270848 2020-11-02 01:20:23 -0500 <pprakash94> @NilimDutta 100%. The “order” of critiquing isn’t something I’m questioning. I just want to establish that no idea is off the table.
1323161337606725632 2020-11-02 01:13:40 -0500 <pprakash94> @Burairss @Ssaniya_ @NilimDutta https://t.co/Ioo5QtTHCc

1322958467875758080 2020-11-01 11:47:32 -0500 <pprakash94> 😂😂😂 Hilarious. Powershift FC have had a safe landing.
1317437402252599296 2020-10-17 07:08:48 -0500 <pprakash94> Mane leaves me speechless time and again. What an absolute pleasure to watch.  #EVELIV
1312852836867211264 2020-10-04 15:31:22 -0500 <pprakash94> Credit to Aston Villa. They were solid. As terrible as we were today, Villa played well to and deserved to win by the score line.
1312839454067884034 2020-10-04 14:38:11 -0500 <pprakash94> Shocking performance. Lost for words to how terrible we’ve been from back to front. Adrian and Gomez have been awful.  #AVLLIV
1312796052626448384 2020-10-04 11:45:44 -0500 <pprakash94> 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Hilarious.
1312788935928541186 2020-10-04 11:17:27 -0500 <pprakash94> @noobharish That too. 😂 #GlazersIn
1312787906050752514 2020-10-04 11:13:21 -0500 <pprakash94> @noobharish United look finished.  Need to get a proper manager. Ole simply isn’t good enough.
1312786972490952706 2020-10-04 11:09:39 -0500 <pprakash94> @PandeyAshish482 😂😂😂😂 Theatre of Broken Dreams. 🤣
1312715584551809024 2020-10-04 06:25:59 -0500 <pprakash94> @jmemc55 2020 is a leap year. Only fair we wait another day to give him a chance.
1310872258177449984 2020-09-29 04:21:15 -0500 <pprakash94> @noobharish True. But the resilience shown in defense by Arsenal this season was impressive. Very unlike previous seasons where chances and goals came by for fun.
1310685100170911745 2020-09-28 15:57:33 -0500 <pprakash94> Unbelievably dominant performance against a resilient Arsenal side. Great to have Jota score on his debut. Mane simply spectacular once again. #LIVARS
1310127381617635330 2020-09-27 03:01:23 -0500 <pprakash94> @Agrimonious You one upped their C by writing C++. 🤣👍🏼
1310107887641878528 2020-09-27 01:43:55 -0500 <pprakash94> @LifeMathMoney While the research is still going on several research studies seem to be further strengthening the argument for a biological predisposition for it. You aren’t “regressive” or a “homophobe”. You are however, poorly read on the topic. Facts don’t care about your feelings
1309727636256518150 2020-09-26 00:32:56 -0500 <pprakash94> @HereticGoan Timeless classic.
1308778257664204806 2020-09-23 09:40:27 -0500 <pprakash94> @bangtanapy @saahilmenghani Yep. Noticed that too. Found it rather odd. Majority of the accounts seem to be created from June 2020 onwards and typically work to trend certain hashtags. It’s fairly obvious that these are fake accounts.
1308295762221047810 2020-09-22 01:43:11 -0500 <pprakash94> @LFCismyblood @JoeGomezEra 🤣🤣🤣 Underrated tweet.
1307737429684531200 2020-09-20 12:44:34 -0500 <pprakash94> Mane yet again world class. I say it week after week he’s arguably the best player in the world atm.  Also, brilliant debut by Thiago. Excited to see the finesse he brings to our midfield.  #CHELIV
1307022122259156992 2020-09-18 13:22:11 -0500 <pprakash94> Truly an unbelievable signing. This is perhaps the first established world beater we’ve signed in the PL era. Off the top of my head the only player that comes close in terms of proven star quality prior to signing was probably Fernando Torres.
1307021063235096576 2020-09-18 13:17:59 -0500 <pprakash94> @Jfunnell888 @joerogan Let’s hope the signing Jota rumour isn’t one of them though. 😂👍🏼
1304848515147816960 2020-09-12 13:25:03 -0500 <pprakash94> Mad game. Salah world class yet again. Leeds will be a great side to watch.  But it’s time to invest in the market. The team needs reinforcements.
1304327190280978432 2020-09-11 02:53:30 -0500 <pprakash94> In the midst of all the one-upmanship, sensationalism, disingenuous narratives, and unsavoury language this is a breath of fresh air.
1303962123354009600 2020-09-10 02:42:51 -0500 <pprakash94> To draw up an analogy - “the wings” go in with a preconceived notion on matters and cherry-pick the data points that comply with their priors. A true Centrist uses the outliers to update their beliefs and work the model into compliance like a Bayesian Model.
1303957971831934976 2020-09-10 02:26:21 -0500 <pprakash94> A fantastic thread that captures the mindset of a centrist perfectly. People get so caught up with ideologies and identities that their tribal loyalty often comes at the expense of the truth.
1303603010023485440 2020-09-09 02:55:52 -0500 <pprakash94> At last, a voice of reason. Be it Rhea or Kangana, it is more than evident that they are both being used as proxies to settle political scores between the Maharashtra Government and the Centre. All this while we’re in the midst of a global pandemic.
1301062415228891137 2020-09-02 02:40:27 -0500 <pprakash94> 😆😂🤣😭 Mad stat.

1300858974124699648 2020-09-01 13:12:02 -0500 <pprakash94> @HereticGoan @prempanicker @sumanthraman Spot on. The guy truly embarrassed himself to the “normal” folks watching.
1300832218751709184 2020-09-01 11:25:43 -0500 <pprakash94> @HereticGoan @prempanicker @sumanthraman Lmaooo. Glad I wasn’t the only one who noticed it. 😂🤣 He tried twice and couldn’t find an analogy. Hilarious. 😂
1300713161721409539 2020-09-01 03:32:38 -0500 <pprakash94> At last. Someone had to say it.  The journalistic standards of today are beyond embarrassing. Really insulting the audience’s intelligence by patronising us with such pathetic coverage.

1300481804588048385 2020-08-31 12:13:18 -0500 <pprakash94> @storytellergeet @s3nkul The only thing I questioned was how bigotry was being conflated with immaturity and a lack of representation and you’re bringing in “calling out privilege” when I never even positioned myself against it. You’re arguing with yourself at this point. 🤦🏻‍♂️
1300431494159065090 2020-08-31 08:53:23 -0500 <pprakash94> @GrizzKhan @LFC If @TheSaItIsHere could do it for Utd I don’t see why we can’t.
1300408943655530498 2020-08-31 07:23:47 -0500 <pprakash94> @storytellergeet @s3nkul Except I never even said that he shouldn't. That wasn't even what I said. This is such a pointless conversation if you can't objectively draw a distinction between organised persecution/discrimination and immaturity or a lack of representation. Goodbye, and good luck.
1300328351693824000 2020-08-31 02:03:32 -0500 <pprakash94> @storytellergeet @s3nkul Anybody of any age should be allowed to ask questions, but when somebody conflates immaturity with unadulterated, on the sleeve bigotry it’s utter foolishness. The moment I realised he was 17, I realised I was being unfair, apologised and didn't engaging any further.
1300070561356288001 2020-08-30 08:59:10 -0500 <pprakash94> @s3nkul Sorry, had no idea you were 17. No wonder you seem to have trouble distinguishing between immaturity and straight-up, unapologetic bigotry. Good luck my friend.
1300068126885703681 2020-08-30 08:49:30 -0500 <pprakash94> @happyoye @s3nkul 100% agree with you here. I'm all for representation and believe in providing a platform to people from multiple backgrounds, but it's important to make a distinction between a lack of representation and brash, unapologetic bigotry.
1300066988446818304 2020-08-30 08:44:58 -0500 <pprakash94> 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 The greatest announcement video of all time.

1300055129576538115 2020-08-30 07:57:51 -0500 <pprakash94> @s3nkul Okay? Except I never endorsed her views. I merely contested your ridiculous claim which compared NL and Akash Banerjee with extreme bigotry. Which again, you still don’t seem to have an answer to.
1300017802040885251 2020-08-30 05:29:31 -0500 <pprakash94> @s3nkul Considering you tweeted it in the first place I'd say you were quite bothered. You should probably ask them directly about their employment demographics. I answered your ridiculous claim on "How are they any different.." for which you unfortunately don't seem to have an answer.
1300014655310446593 2020-08-30 05:17:01 -0500 <pprakash94> @AliMoAdil @s3nkul Considering you believe to "Speak only when your words are better than your silence", I understand and respect the need to cop out. Farewell.
1300013391159861249 2020-08-30 05:12:00 -0500 <pprakash94> @AliMoAdil @s3nkul I've watched Kal Ho Naa Ho, so yes. But what about it?
1300013109860397057 2020-08-30 05:10:53 -0500 <pprakash94> @s3nkul @s3nkul, to follow up on the tweet that you conveniently deleted - because they've monetised their YouTube channels they are no different from the people who wear their bigotry on their sleeves? NL and Akash have have used their platform to amplify Dalit voices through guests. https://t.co/U7pJyaK3fn
1300008906714832897 2020-08-30 04:54:11 -0500 <pprakash94> @s3nkul "How are they any different...?" They've been vocal about the inequity and injustice being faced today while the other side completely denies it. Such a foolish stand to have.
1299637282610114560 2020-08-29 04:17:28 -0500 <pprakash94> @BeerBicepsGuy History is interesting and important. What’s concerning however, is how increasingly politicised it has become over the years where our first PM, and many of our freedom fighters are abused to no end to score political points.
1299597789211455488 2020-08-29 01:40:32 -0500 <pprakash94> @ganeshchetan Looking sharp sir. 👍🏼
1299376844844589056 2020-08-28 11:02:35 -0500 <pprakash94> @QuicklyOrigi @EmiratesFACup @TLister77 @Arsenal @LFC Mane second best LW? He’s the best player. Period.
1299331784765628416 2020-08-28 08:03:32 -0500 <pprakash94> @Wootsaw A few months back you said something about “absolutist statements” being problematic. It resonates perfectly with today’s situation. LW or RW doesn’t matter - the extreme ends of the spectrum are incredibly dangerous especially when it comes at the expense of the objective truth.
1299309970085699585 2020-08-28 06:36:51 -0500 <pprakash94> The kind of uncouth, vulgar language being hurled at a 28 year old girl on national television by some of the media channels is beyond appalling. The case has been handed over to the CBI, let them investigate and arrive at a verdict but this circus of a media trial must stop.
1299280083216035841 2020-08-28 04:38:05 -0500 <pprakash94> @Logic_Observer @DOCTORATLARGE Spot on with the observation there.
1298860964104687616 2020-08-27 00:52:40 -0500 <pprakash94> @just_barath @YouTubeIndia Technically none of the channels you’re referring to are funded directly by the state through taxpayers. It’s political parties that own them. (Barring Doordarshan ie)
1298105896136933376 2020-08-24 22:52:17 -0500 <pprakash94> @smitaprakash @AartiTikoo Truly disappointing to see that not wanting to subscribe to uncouth behaviour is considered a “privilege”.  Very low standards set indeed.
1298103667124396032 2020-08-24 22:43:26 -0500 <pprakash94> @AartiTikoo What a terrible perspective. If anything it’s the supposed “grown ups” that need to grow up.  Are you really suggesting that there isn’t a way to have civil discourse without shouting at each other and getting personal? This uncouth behaviour has sadly been normalised.
1297895234081185793 2020-08-24 08:55:12 -0500 <pprakash94> Captures things perfectly. Questioning the government isn’t “political”, it’s a fundamental right that should cuts across party lines.
1297480053924589568 2020-08-23 05:25:25 -0500 <pprakash94> Agreed. Never easy to take on these competitive exams. While there are no perfect solutions during these imperfect times, it certainly would help if the government considered pushing the exams up by at least a few days given that many students were expecting a postponement.
1297222591287930880 2020-08-22 12:22:21 -0500 <pprakash94> @Banzaaraaa @GabbbarSingh No worries at all.  I understand the perspective you’re trying to table. My only argument is that  skepticism and evidence/empirical based inference aren’t ideas that are foreign to our region. They are well explored albeit not mainstream ideas.
1297144402423382017 2020-08-22 07:11:39 -0500 <pprakash94> @Banzaaraaa @GabbbarSingh With all due respect I’d implore you to explore ancient schools of philosophy such as Ajivika, Astika, and Samkhya. While they are not mainstream ideas they certainly do an excellent job exploring these ideas in the Indian context.
1297138212503076864 2020-08-22 06:47:04 -0500 <pprakash94> @Banzaaraaa @GabbbarSingh Looks like we mostly agree. I suppose where we primarily differ is on our approach to the question. It's a skepticism vs faith debate the way I see things. It all depends on the school of thought one chooses to follow here.
1297136043032895488 2020-08-22 06:38:26 -0500 <pprakash94> @Banzaaraaa @GabbbarSingh 100% agree that there's a lot left to be worked out. While absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, it certainly isn't evidence for presence either.
1297133988092325888 2020-08-22 06:30:17 -0500 <pprakash94> @Banzaaraaa @GabbbarSingh I agree with scientists maintaining a speculative stance by default. But the Darwinian Model has been long proven to be true beyond any reasonable doubt. We observe random mutations and natural selection everywhere. Evolution is an accepted reality in the scientific community.
1297129600229576705 2020-08-22 06:12:50 -0500 <pprakash94> @Banzaaraaa @GabbbarSingh Not sure who are the atheists are that you’re following but the foundational ideas of atheism stem from evolutionary biologists and physicists who work towards explaining the origin of life and the universe.
1297127541967163392 2020-08-22 06:04:40 -0500 <pprakash94> @GabbbarSingh Everyone is an atheist of the religions they don’t practise.
1297127317097996288 2020-08-22 06:03:46 -0500 <pprakash94> @Banzaaraaa @GabbbarSingh Science is the literally the reason most people turn into atheists.

1294704467812577281 2020-08-15 13:36:14 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay That’s great news. I’ve been looking for one for weeks now.  Will you be reopening your clinic/office anytime in the near future?
1294387107247472640 2020-08-14 16:35:09 -0500 <pprakash94> @FPL_FC @FCBarcelona Underrated tweet. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1294382494377054209 2020-08-14 16:16:49 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay LvG wasn’t the worst imo. The fella was just adamant about his philosophy.  But true, right now United look pretty decent and I think they could be a legit challenger for the title if they make a few signings.  Bruno, Greenwood and Martial are looking like the real deal.
1294379754032832512 2020-08-14 16:05:56 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay The current side is completely washed up. Once Messi leaves/retired it’s the final nail in their coffin.
1294315134353989633 2020-08-14 11:49:09 -0500 <pprakash94> Iconic moment that’ll live long in the memory. Never quite seen an impact by a sub on a big occasion in the history of the game.
1294276348878311425 2020-08-14 09:15:02 -0500 <pprakash94> @Agrimonious I think what’s being implied here is the very point you’re trying to make, there is no freedom of press here and as a result journalists are in jail. Also, there are no press conferences for our elected officials to directly face as is the case in the video.

1293602225525161984 2020-08-12 12:36:19 -0500 <pprakash94> A very nuanced. Heartbreaking to see our city succumb to this form of violence. Hopefully swift action is taken against these miscreants at the earliest and we can go to being the peaceful city we are.  #BangaloreViolence

1292763879982813184 2020-08-10 05:05:02 -0500 <pprakash94> Well said. More funds needed from the centre.
1292440546305175553 2020-08-09 07:40:13 -0500 <pprakash94> @foohasmallya Sad, but true. But there's no denying that if we took a poll like the one shown in the pic the results wouldn't be too far off.
1292403244849750016 2020-08-09 05:11:59 -0500 <pprakash94> @SharmaSatyaki Undoubtedly Lewandowski is probably the best 9 in the world right now. But someone like Mane offers so much more than just goals and assists. His dribbling, strength, game intelligence work rate off the ball and mentality is what makes him such an elite player in my opinion.
1292375848230633472 2020-08-09 03:23:08 -0500 <pprakash94> @SharmaSatyaki Close second to Mane. 😂👌🏼

1291685955380731905 2020-08-07 05:41:44 -0500 <pprakash94> How isn’t Virgil on this list? Either way, fingers crossed for Sadio Mane - the best player in the world. ♥️
1291633394325970945 2020-08-07 02:12:53 -0500 <pprakash94> @desiafterdark @VPSecretariat Going by your logic anytime someone goes to the Gym they're worshiping the Greek gods because of it Greek Origins. It's one thing to acknowledge and appreciate the origins of a particular art/science, but it's silly to insist that a practise is inherently religious.

1287730942052724736 2020-07-27 07:45:56 -0500 <pprakash94> @GraemeKelly1 Lallana was key to securing Champions League in the 16/17 season.  Lovren was key to our 17/18 CL Campaign taking us all the way to the finals.  They played their roles well.

Extraordinary commitment &amp; love to the club and the fans. 3. 1-2 iconic moments or an unparalleled level of consistency. 4. Stood for club values &amp; was a leader on &amp; off the pitch.

For the sake of humanity we must do the right thing and void the champions league. In fact I’d go a step further and say that all football must be stopped from Monday.

1286655841878204417 2020-07-24 08:33:52 -0500 <pprakash94> @DaveOCKOP @LFC The best game imo - Liverpool vs Aston Villa, Villa Park. Never gonna forget that moment when Mane scored in the last minute. That was the game I genuinely believed we could see this title race through to the end.

1285153869580779532 2020-07-20 05:05:34 -0500 <pprakash94> @EvertonRshite Absolutely criminal how Mane is third. Best player in the world right now.  Should be leading the poll imo.
1284890453028990976 2020-07-19 11:38:50 -0500 <pprakash94> @sonii1119 Just to be clear - I’m placing the blame on the influential producers, not the star kids themselves.
1284890283348381698 2020-07-19 11:38:10 -0500 <pprakash94> @sonii1119 Yes, I think it’s unfair to blame the star kids as well for the families they are born into. But I do think it very unethical to block and deliberately stifle the careers of outsiders with little/no inside connections.
1284882515585466368 2020-07-19 11:07:18 -0500 <pprakash94> @sonii1119 Think the form of "Nepotism" most people are against isn't about privileged people receiving benefits/opportunities, rather they're against common folk being prevented from getting deliberately receiving these benefits from the insiders at the expense of privileged children.

It’s a shame you choose to trivialise it.
1278385495672684544 2020-07-01 12:50:28 -0500 <pprakash94> @BurnItDownSan @kiranjune1976 @sardesairajdeep I can’t account for what Mr. Rajdeep says. Either way you seemed to have diverted all the attention from our unpaid doctors to a pointless political conversation.

1273922649387749376 2020-06-19 05:16:42 -0500 <pprakash94> @kingfisherontap For sure. I personally believe that these influential accounts should leverage their platform to at least talk about one issue - big or small. But it looks like some people genuinely don't care or are simply not informed enough. It's shallow, but unfortunately true.
1273919333387784192 2020-06-19 05:03:32 -0500 <pprakash94> @kingfisherontap Don't you think this is a bit unfair? Isn't it better than feigning interest or worse -  spreading misinformation about genuine social/political issues if/when a person isn't well informed on these respective topics?
1271481317553606658 2020-06-12 11:35:43 -0500 <pprakash94> @PonnathPuraaNa @Waseem_Ahmed11 @BJP4India @BJP4Karnataka Well said, BSY is a proper grassroots leader who actually understands the state and its values.  We'd be remotely controlled from New Delhi if we have a BJP Govt without him leading it.
1271362863001559040 2020-06-12 03:45:01 -0500 <pprakash94> @vishj05 Ironically BHU had some of the highest anti CAA representations. 🤣
1271043702954143744 2020-06-11 06:36:48 -0500 <pprakash94> @Virodhanam_dhi Agreed, but the EXACT same things can be said about RW people as well.
1270716933537595397 2020-06-10 08:58:20 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay Video got pulled down, any idea who this YouTuber/Content Creator is?
1270716590263132160 2020-06-10 08:56:58 -0500 <pprakash94> @Waseem_Ahmed11 Well done Sir. Called out the "act" more than "individual".
1270608413194518533 2020-06-10 01:47:07 -0500 <pprakash94> @aparnanadig1 Which City in Karnataka? Also where and how is the facility?
1269852993823764481 2020-06-07 23:45:21 -0500 <pprakash94> @NotoriousJOS @Migeycan Also let’s not forget - an incredible big game player.
1268064763092721665 2020-06-03 01:19:33 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay If you recall back in 2013/14 OnePlus sold their phones on an invite basis only, which created a great deal of hype around the brand by starving the general public of their phones. Not exactly flash sale per se, but a very similar model as we can see.
1268063993983164416 2020-06-03 01:16:30 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay While these Flash Sales aren’t designed to garner large profits, they certainly are effective marketing campaigns for creating a sense of exclusivity. By getting a randomised sample of customers they are also able to get feedback for future product releases.
1267999910252560385 2020-06-02 21:01:51 -0500 <pprakash94> @BegumMentalJaan @WiseDonkay That's his personal choice? He shouldn't be expected to have spoken about an "approved list" of topics in order to speak about a genuine ongoing cause.
1267758946938318851 2020-06-02 05:04:21 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay 1. Sorry, I use “sir” as a sign of respect in the hopes of a amicable discussion.  2. Okay.  3. Fair enough.
1267758422885167105 2020-06-02 05:02:16 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay If anything he should be made aware of the genuine Indian issues of today and encouraged to talk about them as well, not silenced for speaking of the injustices in a “foreign land”.  One doesn’t have to come at the expense of the other.
1267757677049856000 2020-06-02 04:59:18 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay Sir, I agree that he should raise his voice about other issues as well. My only question is why does he need to have a track record of talking about other issues to talk about an ongoing genuine issue? Can’t this be his way of learning of the other atrocities as well?
1267755955833323520 2020-06-02 04:52:28 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay Sorry, this logic is absolutely ridiculous.  You don’t need to have friends who are subject to a particular form of oppression to support the cause.
1267755159473369090 2020-06-02 04:49:18 -0500 <pprakash94> @WiseDonkay So... he shouldn’t post about BML because he hasn’t spoken about the aforementioned topics you’ve listed out?
1263138470190448641 2020-05-20 11:04:13 -0500 <pprakash94> @nehajoychauhan @chetan_bhagat So a person isn't allowed to change their political views ever?
1263024668514103299 2020-05-20 03:32:01 -0500 <pprakash94> @JamesPearceLFC @Liddellpool So what you're saying is we're signing Werner, Sancho, Koulibaly? Message received.
1262069806167060480 2020-05-17 12:17:44 -0500 <pprakash94> @bnceoffmybelly @KopalMukim A little late, but do you still even now?
1261337526561726464 2020-05-15 11:47:55 -0500 <pprakash94> @RedHeadLFC @merkseyside @Elondras Yes, for the most part the right and the left here are usually pro-welfare state. (at least they pretend to be) It's only over matters of religion and other social policies where there's a massive, massive rift.
1261335631285936129 2020-05-15 11:40:23 -0500 <pprakash94> @RedHeadLFC @merkseyside @Elondras Actually it's the leanings of a left-leaning centrist.  Then again, this is what the definition of "centrist" is here in India.  Given some of the radical views held by the far-left here it's important that I make that distinction.
1261334379793547264 2020-05-15 11:35:25 -0500 <pprakash94> @RedHeadLFC @merkseyside @Elondras The best example I could give you would be the way Covid Testing for was carried out in South Korea. Testing was privatised early on to help businesses while the tests themselves were paid for by the government
1261333892922929152 2020-05-15 11:33:29 -0500 <pprakash94> @RedHeadLFC @merkseyside @Elondras Except I agree with you - I do believe in workers rights and higher taxes for the rich. But I also believe in encouraging the private sector to participate in the economy and government related schemes.
1261331112762081280 2020-05-15 11:22:26 -0500 <pprakash94> @merkseyside @RedHeadLFC @Elondras Except we don't believe there's a middle ground b/w Facism and No Facism. We simply believe in nuance and more empirical and quantifiable approaches towards the implementation of certain policies.
1261329601608814594 2020-05-15 11:16:26 -0500 <pprakash94> @RedHeadLFC @Elondras I wouldn't really call them real centrists, pal. They're just opportunistic businessmen. The best example of a successful centrist model would be the current South Korean government. They protect the working class while letting the private sector thrive as well.
1261328496778899456 2020-05-15 11:12:02 -0500 <pprakash94> @RedHeadLFC @Elondras Then again, this is the definition of centrists here in India. So I understand your perspective.
1261328129760485378 2020-05-15 11:10:35 -0500 <pprakash94> @RedHeadLFC @Elondras That's why I insisted on "independent thinking" centrists who are willing to adapt to changing circumstances.  Most centrists believe in subsidised healthcare policies and protecting the working class. The disagreements are usually over choosing the right model to get there.
1261324847377870848 2020-05-15 10:57:32 -0500 <pprakash94> @Elondras @RedHeadLFC Couldn't agree more. And this is true worldwide. The current political climate is in grave need of independent thinking centrists.
1260078739771121667 2020-05-12 00:25:57 -0500 <pprakash94> @SaketGokhale @Paromita2005 @HavaldarShinde Couldn’t be further from the truth. I voted in 2014, because of the promises made for the Indian economy. After getting a better understanding of the communal politics being practised, I (and my friends) changed my mind. Absolutist statements like this are complete disgrace.
1254102991474311173 2020-04-25 12:40:27 -0500 <pprakash94> @davothkelly Big fan, Davoth. Stay safe. 👍🏼
1254074138299297794 2020-04-25 10:45:48 -0500 <pprakash94> @davothkelly What are your thoughts on the Dom who plays for Bournemouth? 🤣
1253682400564875266 2020-04-24 08:49:11 -0500 <pprakash94> @AbhinandanSekhr @vivekagnihotri @MakrandParanspe @TheJaggi @TVMohandasPai Thank you Abhinandan, really appreciate it. 👍
1253647217438539777 2020-04-24 06:29:22 -0500 <pprakash94> @AbhinandanSekhr @vivekagnihotri @MakrandParanspe @TheJaggi @TVMohandasPai Sir, I'm subscribed to NewsLaundry, but I'm unable to find this interview with @vivekagnihotri. Could you kindly share the link with me?
